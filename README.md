Assumptions:
● Mach number at the exit of the tube is taken as 1, minimum needed
for the supersonic jet. For higher Mach numbers the algorithm is not
perfect as the distances what we get has a lot of difference it can be
rectified by MOC.
● The height of Mach-stem is taken as Diameter of the projectile to
avoid complications.
● Considered a single oblique shock instead of compression of several
reflected characteristics to avoid complication.
● Considered everything except oblique and moving shocks as
isentropic.
Formulae:
Normal shock and moving shock relations:
● p1 / p0 = [2* gam * M^2 - (gam - 1)] / (gam + 1)
● T1 / T0 = [2 * gam * M^2 - (gam - 1)] * [(gam - 1) * M^2 + 2] / [(gam + 1)^2 * M^2]
● M1^2 = [(gam - 1) * M^2 + 2] / [2 * gam * M^2 - (gam - 1)]
● pt1 / pt0 = {[(gam + 1) * M^2 ] / [(gam - 1) *M^2 + 2]}^[gam/(gam-1)] * {(gam + 1) /[2 *
gam * M^2 - (gam - 1)]}^[1/(gam - 1)]
Prandtl Meyer angle:
● nu = {sqrt[(gam+1)/(gam-1)]} * atan{sqrt[(gam-1)*(M^2
